Lately I have been doing a fair amount of introspection: what I want to do with my life, where I want to be in five
years, and how I want to get there. This has led to a fair amount of frustration in my day to day work, as things don't
seem to be lining up in the ways that I had hoped.

In my workplace there is a large amount of "Generation Y" types, myself included. However, we don't quite fit the GenY
mold, there is something else going on here.

I am a part of the "Startup Generation". This is the generation that has grown up seeing companies appear from no where,
driven by the hard work and skill of the ones at the helm. We grew up with these people as role-models, examples of what
we hope to be.

We want to be rock-stars, to build something from nothing that everyone will want, need, and use. We want it now.
The technology world moves so quickly that if you don't capitalize on an idea right away, chances are someone else is
already working on it.

Fresh out of school and flush with ideas, members of the Startup Generation have few commitments outside of work and bills.
